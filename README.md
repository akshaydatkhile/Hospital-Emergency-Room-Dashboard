📌 **Project Title**
Hospital Emergency Room Analysis Dashboard – Power BI

📝 **Short Description / Purpose**
To enhance operational efficiency and deliver actionable insights into emergency room performance, this project involves the creation of a Hospital Emergency Room Analysis Dashboard using Power BI.
The primary objective is to enable healthcare stakeholders to:
• Track and monitor key metrics such as patient flow, wait times, and service efficiency
• Analyze patterns in ER utilization and identify operational bottlenecks
• Make informed, data-driven decisions to optimize patient management and improve service delivery
This solution serves as a strategic tool to support continuous improvement in emergency room operations through intuitive data visualization and analytics.

🛠 **Tech Stack**

• 📊 Power BI Desktop – Main data visualization platform used for report creation.
• 📂 Power Query – Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.
• 🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.
• 📝 Data Modeling – Relationships established among tables (resorts, snow, and data_dictionary) to enable cross-filtering and aggregation.
• 📁 File Format – .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.

📂 **Data Source**

Mock hospital ER data simulating real-world metrics
(e.g., patient admission time, triage level, wait time, discharge status)

🌟 **Features / Highlights**

•📊 Wait Time & Satisfaction: Average wait time was ~35.3 minutes with a satisfaction score of 4.99/10, indicating scope for improvement.
•🧭 Departmental Referrals: Most patients didn’t need referrals; common ones were to General Practice and Orthopedics.
•🧑‍⚕️ Peak Busy Periods: Mondays and late hours (11 AM, 1 PM, 7 PM, 11 PM) saw the highest patient volumes.
•🧑‍⚕️ Patient Demographics: Most patients were aged 20–39; majority were White and African American.
•🕒 Admission Patterns: Nearly equal split between admitted (4,612) and treated & released (4,604) patients.
•📝 Key Insight: High volume, moderate satisfaction, and clear peak hours inform better staffing and service planning.
